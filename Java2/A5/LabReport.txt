# Benchmarking the ArrayStrand implementation

## Show that ArrayStrand.cutAndSplice() is O(N)
Record your response here.

ArrayStrand:	 splice length	              524,288 	 time 	 0.162
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	            1,048,576 	 time 	 0.294 
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	            2,097,152 	 time 	 0.558 
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	            4,194,304 	 time 	 1.909 
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	            8,388,608 	 time 	 3.992 
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	           16,777,216 	 time 	 11.867 
ArrayStrand:	 splice length	           33,554,432 	 time 	 32.299 

It has a for loop and everything surrounding that for loop and inside it is constant meaning the method is O(N).

Ratios 2.72,2.973, 2.091, 3.421, 1.898,  1.814
log Base 2 of a majority of these ratios results in a k constant of 1 which means the time complexity of the ArrayStrandâ€™s cutAndSplice would be linear.

## Determine the largest power-of-two splice supported with 512M heap
Record your response here.
2^15 or 2,768

## Determine the largest power-of-two splice supported with 1024M heap
Record your response here.

2^17 or 131,072. It took .261 seconds.

## Determine the largest power-of-two splice supported as heap doubles
Record your response here.

The splice size double with each doubling of the heap size. It stops at 2^25 or 33,554,432.


# Verifying the LinkedStrand implementation

## Show that LinkedStrand.cutAndSplice() is O(1)
Record your response here.
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	           16,777,216 	 time 	 0.002 recombinant length          755,294,610
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	           33,554,432 	 time 	 0.002 recombinant length        1,510,269,330
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	           67,108,864 	 time 	 0.002 recombinant length        3,020,218,770
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	          134,217,728 	 time 	 0.002 recombinant length        6,040,117,650
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	          268,435,456 	 time 	 0.001 recombinant length       12,079,915,410
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	          536,870,912 	 time 	 0.003 recombinant length       24,159,510,930
LinkedStrand:	 splice length	        1,073,741,824 	 time 	 0.007 recombinant length       48,318,701,970

As seen by the times by running LinkedStrand through DnaSimulation, the time generally remains around .001 to .002 seconds with the occasional outlier but overall the time complexity is obviously constant.
